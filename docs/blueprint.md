# **App Name**: Docutrack

## Core Features:

- Google Authentication: Enable users to log in to the application using their Google account. Firebase Auth will handle authentication.
- Event Creation: Allow users to create a new event by providing a title; events will serve as a container for related documents.

- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, known for its clean and readable design.
- Use minimalistic icons to represent document types and actions.
- Display document cards in a responsive grid layout.
